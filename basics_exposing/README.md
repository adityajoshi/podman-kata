### Basics Exposing

This exercise uses two applications: times and cities. The times application returns the
current time of a given city, and the cities application returns information about a specific
city. 

To fetch the current time of the city, the cities application fetches data from the times
application.

### Step 1 - Examine the source code of the applications.

### Step 2 - Create a Podman network with DNS enabled.

### Step 3 - Start and test the times application attached to the cities network.

### Step 4 - Start and test the cities application attached to the cities network.
